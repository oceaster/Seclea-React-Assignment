## Problems, solutions and examples

For some reason the large image preview loads quite slowly sometimes. I'm not sure if this because of the loading of the image itself or because of the way the image is being display - however this will need be investigated as it is quite irritating at the moment.

Further more we could expand on our feature scope of the application upon solving any technical issues in the current build - such as being able to close the large image preview by click anywhere outside of the picture window and not just by clicking on the image itself.

Other additions would involve styling.
